<P> 
This model editor page allows you to add less-often
used parts of a model.&nbsp;  It's a good idea to browse
this page just to see what options it provides, since
some of the features are not ones you would expect.
 </P>

<h2><a name="additional">Additional Definitions</a></h2>

<p>
It is sometimes convenient to define operators just
for use in the expressions that specify a model.&nbsp;  For
example, you might want to define an operator that
you use can use in more than one invariant.&nbsp;  If you
don't want those definitions to be part of the spec,
you can put them in this section of the page.&nbsp;  These
definitions can use any operator or parameters that
can be used in the the root module, as well as any
<a href="model-values.html">model value</a> that is
declared in the model.
</p>

<p>
In addition to definitions, in this section you can also 
put assumptions (<code>ASSUME</code>&nbsp; statements)
for TLC to check.&nbsp;  Putting other
things in this section, such as declarations,
will result in mysterious TLC errors.

</p>
<h2><a name="state">State Constraint</a></h2>

<p>
Many behavior specifications have an infinite set of reachable 
states.&nbsp;  For example, message queues could get arbitrarily large.&nbsp;  
TLC will run forever (or until your computer runs out
of disk space) on such a behavior spec.&nbsp;  You could just let it
run and keep looking for violations of safety properties such as invariance.&nbsp;
However, it's a better idea to limit the set of states by entering
a state constraint here.
</p>

<p>
A state constraint is a state predicate, which is a
Boolean-valued expression that contains unprimed variables.&nbsp;
When computing the set of reachable states, TLC will not
explore successor states of any state it finds that does
<em>not</em> satisfy the state constraint.&nbsp;  For example,
specifying&nbsp; <code>len < 3</code>&nbsp; essentially
limits the set of reachable states that TLC finds to ones
that can be reached by a sequence of states in which 
the value of the variable&nbsp; <code>len</code>&nbsp; 
is less than 3.&nbsp;  See Section 14.3 (page 240) of 
<em><a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" target="_blank">
Specifying Systems</a></em> for an explanation of how TLC
computes reachable states.&nbsp;  Note that there is no need
for multiple state constraints because they can simply be
conjoined to form a single constraint.
</p>

<!-- 
<p>A state constraint has an effect only in model checking mode.  (See
<a href="#launching">TLC Options</a>.)
</p>
 -->

<h2><a name="model">Model Values</a></h2>

You can enter here a set of model values, which you can then
use in expressions that define the model--for example, in
the value substituted for a declared constant.&nbsp;  See the
<A href="model-values.html"><em>Model Values and Symmetry</em></A> help
page for an explanation of what model values are and how they
are used.

<h2><a name="override">Definition Override</a></h2>
<p>
We want our specifications to be as simple and easy to understand as
possible.&nbsp;  Sometimes this leads to a definition that TLC cannot evaluate,
or that it can evaluate only very inefficiently.&nbsp;  In that case, we
must <em>override</em> the definition by telling TLC to replace it with
a new definition.&nbsp;   To do this, click on the section's&nbsp; <samp>Add</samp>&nbsp;
button, select the operator whose definition you want to override, and 
click&nbsp; <samp>OK</samp>&nbsp;.&nbsp;  (You can also double-click on the
operator name.)&nbsp;  This will raise a dialog in which you can specify
the overriding.
</p>

<p>
If the operator whose definition you are overriding has arguments,
you will be presented with a form for writing the new definition in
the obvious way.&nbsp;  If it has no arguments, you have two
options.&nbsp;  With the <em>Ordinary assignment</em> option, you just
write the new definition.&nbsp;  The <em>Model value</em> option
defines the operator to equal a model value of the same name.&nbsp;
See the
<A href="model-values.html"><em>Model Values and Symmetry</em></A> help
page for an explanation of model values and the most common
reason why you would want to override the definition in this way.
</p>

<p>
You can override definitions made in modules other than the root module.&nbsp;
If a definition is in a module imported with an&nbsp; <samp>INSTANCE</samp>&nbsp;
statement, then the name of the module may be indicated.
</p>

<p>
You can edit or remove an overriding specification in the obvious way: by selecting it and
using the&nbsp; <samp>Edit</samp>&nbsp; or&nbsp; <samp>Remove</samp>&nbsp; button.&nbsp;
(Editing is also selected by double-clicking on the item.)
</p>

<p fontsize=80%>
<b>Some Fine Print</b>&nbsp;
<font size=-1>
When overriding a definition, 
the new definition can use any operator or parameters that
can be used in the the root module, as well as any
<a href="model-values.html">model value</a> that is
declared in the model.&nbsp;  This means that you can override
a definition with an expression that
contains operators that are undefined at the point where the
original definition occurred.&nbsp;
TLC evaluates overridden definitions in the
obvious way, and bizarre overriding can
lead to strange results.&nbsp;  For example, if&nbsp; <samp>Fact</samp>&nbsp; is defined by
<pre>
   Fact(n)  ==  IF n = 0 THEN 1 ELSE n * Bar(n-1)
</pre>
and the definition of&nbsp; <samp>Bar</samp>&nbsp; is overridden with
<pre>
   Bar(n) <- Fact(n)
</pre>
then TLC will evaluate&nbsp; <samp>Fact(n)</samp>&nbsp; to 
equal&nbsp; <samp>n!</samp>&nbsp; for any natural 
number&nbsp; <samp>n</samp>&nbsp;.&nbsp;
There is no good reason to use such bizarre overriding.</font>

<h2><a name="action">Action Constraint</a></h2>

An action constraint is much like a <a href="#state">state constraint</a>, except 
that the constraint formula may also include primed variables.&nbsp;
See Section 14.3 (page 240) of 
<em><a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" target="_blank">
Specifying Systems</a></em> for an explanation of how TLC uses an
action constraint.

<h2><a name="launching">TLC Options</a></h2>

You can choose between two basic ways of running TLC:

<h3><a  name="model-mode">Model-checking mode</a></h3>
<p>
This is the normal method of running TLC, in which it 
essentially tries to check all possible behaviors allowed
by the behavior spec.&nbsp;  Its default method of doing this
is to find the graph of all reachable states using
breadth-first search.&nbsp;  This has the advantage that if
TLC finds a violation of a safety property, then it will
produce a shortest possible behavior that exhibits the
error.&nbsp;  You can direct TLC to use a depth-first search
by choosing the <em>Depth-first</em> option and specifying
the depth of its search.&nbsp;  (Limiting the depth ensures
that only a finite set of states is explored, even if
the complete set of reachable states is infinite.)&nbsp;
With depth-first search, TLC will usually not produce
a shortest-length error trace.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning:</b> Depth-first search is an experimental TLC
option that has not been used much. We don't even know
if it really works, let alone if it offers any advantages.
If you do try it, let us know what you discover.
</p>

<p>
You can also specify a <em>View</em> to be used in model-checking
mode.&nbsp;  If you're curious about what that is and how it is used,
see Section 14.3.3 (page 243) of 
<em><a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" target="_blank">
Specifying Systems</a></em>. 
</p>
<h3>Simulation Mode</h3>

<p>
In simulation mode, TLC does not try to examine all reachable states.&nbsp;
Instead, it checks an unending series of behaviors, each of which it constructs by
starting from a randomly choosen initial state and repeatedly making a random
choice of a possible next state.&nbsp;  (In this mode, you  stop TLC by clicking the&nbsp;
<samp>Cancel</samp>&nbsp; button on the dialog that the Toolbox pops up when it
runs TLC.)&nbsp; You specify the maximum length of each behavior that it generates.&nbsp;
If you want to know what specifying the <em>Seed</em> and <em>Aril</em> does,
look them up in
<em><a href=
"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/book.html" target="_blank">
Specifying Systems</a></em>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Warning:</b> Because of a bug in TLC, checking of liveness properties does not
work in simulation mode.  Also, when run in <a href="distributed-mode.html">distributed mode</a>,
only model-checking mode is used.
</p>

<h3>Fingerprint seed index</h3>
<p>
TLC saves only 64-bit fingerprints (hashes) of the reachable states that it finds, not the
complete states.&nbsp;  If two different reachable states have the same fingerprint, a situtation
called a  <em>collision</em>, TLC may not find all reachable states.&nbsp;  
At the
end of a run, TLC prints estimates of how likely it was that a collision occurred.&nbsp;
If you're worried that a collision might have occurred, you can re-run the model with a
different fingerprint function.&nbsp;  The fingerprint seed index specifies which of 64 fingerprint
functions TLC should use.&nbsp; If the two runs produce different numbers of reachable
states, then there was a collision in at least one of the runs.&nbsp;  If not, the probability
that there was a collision in both is the square of the probability that either one had
a collision--a probability that is probably very, very small.

<h3>Log base 2 of number of disk storage files</h3>

If your computer has multiple disk drives, setting this parameter to a value greater
than 0 might make it possible to reduce the time
TLC spends writing to disk on a model with a very large number of reachable states.&nbsp;

Contact us for more information.

<h3> Cardinality of largest enumerable set</h3>

If TLC tries to enumerate the elements of a set, it will report an error if the set
contains more than this number of elements.&nbsp;  TLC enumerates sets when computing
the set of all initial states.&nbsp;  If you are trying to run a spec with lots of
initial states, you may have to increase the value of this parameter.

<h3><A name="jvmargs">JVM arguments</A></h3>

These are the arguments given to the Java Virtual Machine when TLC is run on the model.&nbsp;  
Certain parameters for running TLC in 
<a href="distributed-mode.html">distributed mode</a> are specified this way.&nbsp; 
Only sophisticated users who know what they are doing should specify other JVM arguments. 

<h3>TLC command line parameters</h3>

These are options given to TLC when it is run on the model.&nbsp;
An incomplete list of TLC options is given in the
  <a href="http://www.tlaplus.net/posts/2009/08/command-line-switches/">Command Line Switches</a>
  posting on the <code>tlaplus.net</code> web page.&nbsp;  
An option specified here can override an option otherwise specified by the rest of the model,
which can cause strange things to happen.&nbsp; You should therefore use this
feature with care.
